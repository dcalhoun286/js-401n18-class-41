## How Do I Use This Application

-- Compatible with iOS and Android mobile devices --

1. Install this app from your device's App Store.
1. When you open the app, you will receive a prompt asking you to give the app permission to access the sensors in your device. This functionality is required in order to monitor your step count.
1. Walk around and watch the counter go up! The step counter will be active as long as the app is open.

Note:

- If you see the following message: **"Is pedometer sensor access on? - no"**, this app will not run properly. In order to fix this, go to your device's Settings were permissions are controlled to verify that this app has access to your phone's sensors.
